Purist-SQLite is a ruby project intended to provide basic read-only access to sqlite3 database files on systems where the sqlite3 gem and associated libraries may not be available. In its current state, it is all but useless, as I made this as a toy.

TODO: 
support overflow tables
add a real interface to things
package up as a gem
add some simple filtering
use indexes for aforementioned filtering
